This project 2 is all about familiaze you with graphic and recursive.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1 
Turtle graphics means a draw an image by moving a turtle around.It's been used in Phthon using turtle library.There's a lot of turtle's function that can be used in the codes such as :
* position
* forward
* color
* backward
* penup
* pendown
* pencolor
* speed
* left
* right
* title

Then at first place,you must include import statement of turtle library
*import turtle

then after we understand the concept,we used it at recursive star where will be implement a function called recursive_star(turtle, 5 , 100, 5, 0.4) as specified below:
-recursive_star(turtle, 5 , 100, 5, 0.4):A recursive function takes 3 int which return an int.It draws 5 pointed star centered at (x,y);each arm has length size.As shown below,it will then recurses at the end of five of the arms with size=360/n.Function draws the dots of size 5 at (x,y) if the size of parameter less than 5.Total number of arms that drawn in his recursion process is the function that has a return value.

In the main function,you can call recursive_star function and finally calls done().
